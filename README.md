# Yasir's Portfolio
**Live Site:** [https://unityefucd.github.io/](https://unityefucd.github.io/)

Welcome to my corner of the internet– my name’s **Yasir**. I’m a second-year student pursuing a **CS degree at MSU Denver** and I basically live in that space where I’m always building and trying to understand what’s happening **under the hood**.

I consider myself a **full-stack engineer**, but I’m especially interested in **low-level systems and architecture**– How programs run, how performance happens, how systems break. I like building across the stack and a big theme in my work is **range + depth**: I’ll do the serious stuff (**systems, networking, distributed thinking**) and I’ll also explore adjacent engineering disciplines like **embedded/electrical systems** and mechanical-style problem solving when it helps me understand real world systems end-to-end.

> I take great care learning the **why** first, then turning it into something real.

This website is my living portfolio: **serious projects, fun builds, technical write-ups, demos, and coursework builds** from my time at university, organized so you can quickly scan what I’ve shipped and dive deeper into my technical write-ups.
